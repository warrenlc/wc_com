    <div id="content"><h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a student at Link√∂ping University, studying computer science.
        Actually, the program is called "Innovativ Programmering" and I think they 
        (the instructors) consider it "innovative" because we have as little theory 
        as allows for a bachelor's degree and focus solely on project work. 
        An English description is given <a href="https://studieinfo.liu.se/en/program/6KIPR/5186">here</a> 
        and a Swedish version <a href="https://studieinfo.liu.se/program/6KIPR/5186">here.</a>
        <br><br>
        I am particularly interested in Linux. My goal is to be a Bash and C wizard, but 
        it is still early days. 
        <br><br>
        In an earlier phase of my life I was a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Though difficult
        to leave something I was good at and enjoyed, I am satisfied with the decision to study
        CS ins>tead.</p> 
    <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
    <p>Because it's awesome. Seriously, I love the challenge and I find it incredibly rewarding.
       After spending years pushing myself physically and mentally on the water, I have become "hooked"
       with the intellectual challenge that is programming. And it's fun as hell.</p>
