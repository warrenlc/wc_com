    <div id="top"><h1>Hello, and Welcome.</h1></div>
    <div id="content"><h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I am a student at Link√∂ping University, studying computer science.
        Actually, the program is called "Innovativ Programmering" and I think they 
        (the instructors) consider it "innovative" because we have as little theory 
        as allows for a bachelor's degree and focus solely on project work. 
        An English description is given <a href="https://studieinfo.liu.se/en/program/6KIPR/5186">here</a> 
        and a Swedish version <a href="https://studieinfo.liu.se/program/6KIPR/5186">here.</a>
        <br><br>
        
        I am particularly interested in Linux. My goal is to be a Bash and C wizard, but 
        it is still early days. 
        <br><br>
        
        In an earlier phase of my life I was a commercial fisherman in Alaska. Though difficult
        to leave something I was good at and enjoyed, I am satisfied with the decision to study
        CS instead.</p> 
    <h1>Why Programming?</h1>
    <p>Because it's awesome. Seriously, I love the challenge and I find it incredibly rewarding.
       After spending years pushing myself physically and mentally on the water, I have become "hooked"
       with the intellectual challenge that is programming. And it's fun as hell.
       </p>
       <h1>Current Projects</h1>
       <p>Currently I am pretty swamped with a school project that involves creating a programming language.
          The work is done with a partner and we intend to make a statically typed language that compiles to 
          Ruby. Yeah, I know...<br>
          However, the purpose is to learn about parsing and what goes into building programming languages -- not
          to make the next Rust replacement. <a href="https://studieinfo.liu.se/en/kurs/TDP019/">Here</a> is a link
          to the course description.
          <br><br>

          Additionally, I recently made a tiny program, my first Bash program, to keep a diary and output it to a pdf.
          Yes, super easy, but I don't think anyone else in my course cares about using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Groff">Groff</a>
          and I thought it was an easy way to streamline the daily diary-entries that are required for the course above.
          You can see that project (as well as others) on my <a href="https://github.com/warrenlc/diary">git hub page.</a>
          <br><br>
          
          I have started also to redo some of the lab assignments from a previous C++ class in C --because I want to learn C.
          Is there a better way to get acquainted with C? Probably. But I will start here.
          </p>
